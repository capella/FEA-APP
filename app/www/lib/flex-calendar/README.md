    defaultDate: new Date([2015, 06, 26]),
    minDate: new Date([2015, 06, 12]),
    maxDate: new Date([2015, 12, 31]),
    disabledDates: [
      new Date([2015, 06, 30]),
      new Date([2015, 07, 25]),
      new Date([2015, 08, 13]),
    ]
    dayNamesLength: 1, // 1 for "M", 2 for "Mo", 3 for "Mon"; 9 will show full day names. Default is 1.
